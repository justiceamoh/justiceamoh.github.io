  role: Research Scientist Intern
  time: Summer 2017
  company: Amazon Inc., Alexa Machine Learning, Cambridge, MA
  details: "Performed speech recognition research at Amazon for the Alexa conversational AI
  system and platform. Work included various machine learning tasks pertaining to Acoustic 
  Event Detection (AED), Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU)."

  role: Postbac Research Assistant
  time: 2013 - 2014
  company: Analog Electronics Lab, Thayer School, NH
  details: "Investigated the feasibility of a piezoelectric-based sensor as wearable 
  device for monitoring asthma symptoms under Dr. Kofi Odame’s supervision. I designed and 
  implemented the piezo-sensor electronics. I explored features of interest in the sensor 
  output and put together signal processing methods to extract the said features. Finally, 
  I explored different machine learning algorithms to automatically detect coughs in the 
  sensor output stream. In this project, I garnered skills in machine learning algorithms, 
  acoustic signal processing and printed circuit board design."

  company: Clinical Applications of Bioimpedance Lab, Thayer School, NH
  details: "Performed research with Dr. Ryan Halter on a small form-factor bioimpedance
  system. I devised a portable tetra-polar impedance analysis system to meet higher 
  efficiency and safety specifications. This involved developing an analog front-end 
  circuit to adapt a stock impedance analyzer chip to meet the higher requirements. 
  In this project, I gained experience in circuit design and implementation for clinical 
  electronic instruments."
- experience:
  role: Undergraduate Research Intern
  time: Summer 2012
  company: Molecular Imaging Instrumentation Lab, Stanford University, CA
  details: "Conducted research in the MII lab of Dr. Craig Levin, in Stanford University’s 
  Radiology Department. We designed a Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) based PET system for 
  imaging small animals. Specifically, I calibrated the detector unit to yield energy 
  spectra of event pulses in units of kev versus event counts. I also devised a system to 
  automatically determine a threshold for noise and trigger the detector on that threshold. 
  From this experience, I acquired skills in digital signal processing and object oriented 
  programming in C++."

  role: Undergraduate Research Assistant
  time: 2011 - 2013
  company: Computational Plasma Physics Lab, Dartmouth College, NH
  details: "Conducted research with Dr. Richard Denton in investigating the dependence of 
  bulk plasma composition at geosynchronous orbit on solar cycle phases. Using MATLAB, we 
  investigated and modeled the changes in particle density of bulk ions with respect to 
  solar cycles, magnetic local time, and seasons. I acquired computational and analytical 
  techniques required to efficiently manage and process enormous data."
